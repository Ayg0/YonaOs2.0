# Yona 2.0

Yona was my first operating system (kind of), where I had the chance to discover siviral interesting topics such as the IDT and GDT and make a small shell with a working timer Wow...
Yona was build from scratch using my own bootloader, this time Yona 2.0 is built on top of the Limine bootloader. 

## What and Why
As what you can obviously tell Yona is my hobby operating system, Why ? well there is always a time where I think "Aaah I wonder how that thing work ?", and the only way to be sure that I know how it works is to re-create it, and Yona is the perfect environment to do so from the ground-up.
